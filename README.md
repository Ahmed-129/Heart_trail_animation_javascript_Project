# Heart Trail Animation

This project is a simple yet visually appealing heart trail animation that follows the user's mouse cursor. The animation is triggered by clicking the "Start Animation" button, after which colorful hearts will trail the cursor's movement across the screen.

## Features

- **Mouse-Triggered Animation**: The animation starts when the user clicks the "Start Animation" button.
- **Dynamic Heart Trail**: Hearts of random sizes follow the cursor, fading out as they move upward.
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions and color changes are achieved using keyframe animations.
- **Congratulatory Message**: The project was successfully completed and uploaded to GitHub as a learning exercise.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The project uses a basic HTML structure with an embedded style and script section.
2. **CSS Styling**: The hearts are styled using CSS with a background image of a heart icon. Keyframe animations handle the movement and fading effects.
3. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript code listens for mouse movements and appends heart elements to the document. The hearts disappear after a short period, creating a smooth trailing effect.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-129/Heart_trail_animation_javascript_Project.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click the "Start Animation" button to begin the heart trail animation.

## Customization

- **Heart Size**: The size of the hearts is randomized using JavaScript, but you can modify the range in the script.
- **Heart Icon**: The heart icon can be replaced by changing the `background` property in the CSS.
- **Animation Speed**: Adjust the duration in the `animation` property of the CSS to speed up or slow down the heart movement.
